#NLU_FF_AC_QD#
v1.7

Whenever you need/want to display the number of articles of any site structure level next to the name of the category, the script does it.

This is the quick and dirty solution!
This is the original **NAV_LIST_UL** of *flip-flop* that was incorporated by OG and now has been extended with
--> easily add the number of articles within a certain site structure level.

The script works exactly like **NAV_LIST_UL**.

**Basics** to read --> http://forum.phpwcms.org/viewtopic.php?t=12165

You can use it with the same prominent parameters and features as usual.
