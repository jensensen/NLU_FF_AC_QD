# NLU_FF_AC_QD #
v1.9.5

## Description: ##
Whenever you need/want to display the number of articles of any site structure level next to the name of the category, the script does it.

This is the quick and dirty solution! This is the original **NAV_LIST_UL** of *flip-flop* that was incorporated by OG and now has been extended with --> easily add the number of articles within a certain site structure level.

The script works exactly like the original **NAV_LIST_UL**, because it's based on the same function.

**Basics** to read --> https://forum.phpwcms.org/viewtopic.php?t=12165

#### For those who are interested why I chose this name: ####
* NLU = NAV_LIST_UL
* FF = flip-flop
* AC = article count
* QD = quick and dirty

You can use it as RT = replacement tag  with the same prominent parameters and features as usual, but instead NAV_LIST_UL just type: NLU_FF_AC_QD... Read also <http://phpwcms.org> and Knut's (aka flip-flop's) [HowTo Wiki]:
